    <h1>CSS IDs</h1>
    <p>An ID is a UNIQUE identifier</p>
    <div>
        <h3>ID Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In CSS an ID starts with a octothorpe (crunch)</li>
            <li>Example uses for IDs: Targeting a specific header or about section</li>
            <li>Each ID should only be used ONCE per page - they are UNIQUE
                <br>
                <em>This is important with Javascript later on</em>
            </li>
            <li>Use for one-off styling</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>IDs versus Classes</h1>
        <h2>IDs</h2>
        <p id="number-one"> This id will be linked in the CSS page by an #</p>
        <p id="number-one number-two"> You cannot use two ids on one element. If you do, neither ID will be applied</p>
        <!-- This will not work. You can't assign the same ID. IDs are UNIQUE. Also, you can't use two IDs on one element. If you do, either ID will be acknowledged -->

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p class="first-class">Elements can have any number of classes</p>
        <p class="first-class second-class">For example, this element has two classes: "first-class" and "second-class"</p>

        <p id="number-one" class="first-class">You CAN TECHNICALLY use an ID twice - VS code will not stop you and you won't get any errors, but YOU SHOULD NOT.</p>

<!-- IDs have priority over everything else -->
